# LPWAN Server (lpwanserver)

This is the CableLabs' [LPWAN Server](http://lpwanserver.com/) project. It is a
React UI that uses a Node.js REST server to manage companies' LPWAN
Applications and Devices on various network servers of various types (LoRa,
NB-IoT, etc.). It collects the data generated by the devices, and forwards
that data to a server for the application.

## Getting started

You'll probably want to start by reading the [LPWAN Server
Overview](http://lpwanserver.com/overview/).

Then, when you're ready, clone this repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cablelabs/lpwanserver.git
```

If you're new to git and GitHub, be sure to check out the [Pro
Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. [GitHub
Help](https://help.github.com/) is also outstanding.

### Install dependencies

```

### Data storage

```
cp ./data/test.sqlite3.testSuiteStartingDB /tmp/test.sqlite3
```

### Testing

### Usage

```
node bin/rest
