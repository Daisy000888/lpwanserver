# LPWAN Server (lpwanserver)

This is the CableLabs' [LPWAN Server](http://lpwanserver.com/) project. It is a
React UI that uses a Node.js REST server to manage companies' LPWAN
Applications and Devices on various network servers of various types (LoRa,
NB-IoT, etc.). It collects the data generated by the devices, and forwards
that data to a server for the application.

## Getting started

You'll probably want to start by reading the
[LPWAN Server Overview](http://lpwanserver.com/overview/).

The easiest way to run LPWAN Server is to follow the
[Quickstart Docker-Compose](http://lpwanserver.com/guides/dockercompose/)
guide.

For development and customization, refer to the
[install documentation](http://lpwanserver.com/install/).

## Web Client

The official LPWAN Server web client is maintained in the
[lpwanserver-web-client](https://github.com/cablelabs/lpwanserver-web-client)
repository.

## Contributing

LPWAN Server was originally built by [CableLabs](http://cablelabs.com/), but
we could use your help! Check out our [contributing guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
