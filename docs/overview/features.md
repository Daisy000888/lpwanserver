## Support many IoT networks in one place

There are many network providers out there, each with their own preferred
technologies.  **LPWAN Server** allows the client application vendor to
configure their application(s) and devices in a single interface for any number
of these network providers at one time, and in one place.

## Support many types of IoT networks

Technologies for IoT devices can vary, from
LoRa ([The LoRa Alliance](https://www.lora-alliance.org)) to
NB-IoT ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NarrowBand_IOT)) to many more.
**LPWAN Server** allows for the unique configuration needs of the technologies
without requiring the redundant and tedious and error-prone re-entry of the
data across many interfaces.

## Data delivery consolidation

The data from the various networks is delivered to the **LPWAN Server**, which
then passes that data back to the client application vendor's system.

## Extendable

**LPWAN Server** was designed to be extendable.  Of course, new networks can be
added as needed, but also new network types (LoRa vs. NB-IoT, etc.) and network
configuration protocols (LoRa Open Source vs. The Things Network) can be added
as needed by the **LPWAN Server** system administrators.  Further, the user
interface can be easily extended to support the new data required by these new
network types.
